# research-funding-portal

A system owned by the Research Council of Norway for receiving and processing applications for research funding. The applicants are representing organizations engaged in research and development. The applicants often have several projects finances by the Norwegian research council at the same time. They wish to see all the projects they have applied for, and the status for each project. They also need to see a summary of each project, including how much money they have been granted. They also want to be able to see and adjust the access for each member of the project.
